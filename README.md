## MAF Frontend Assessment

Hi there! We are happy you are interested in joining the frontend engineering team here at MAF Digital Labs.

The fowllowing excercises are to determine your Frontend coding knowledge and skills.

For this project, we would require you to use custom CSS design system and **VueJS** framework (**Nuxt.js** is a plus).


### Before you start 

1. Create a new github repository, it's important that you don't do Merge Requests to this repository, you will do it over your own new created repository.

2. Every Coding Challenge should be one open Pull Request. At the end of finishing this project you will have one open Pull Request per Coding Challenge. If your code depends on other Pull Request you will point the merge request to the dependant branch instead of `master`.

3. Then after finishing all challenges you need to share the link with moath.alobaidat@maf.ae, mohammad.ihmaid@maf.ae


### Challenges

We want to convert the design you find on https://bit.ly/3kbxOe1 into interactive and responsive experience. Pay attendtion to the details. 


#### Challenge 1 - Mock-up slicing & Data

Design - https://bit.ly/3kbxOe1

For the data, create a json file with any dummy data to consume it dynamically in your application, like section title, section description and section images.

#### Challenge 2 - PWA

As a frontend Developer, you should be able to understand and implement a Service Worker. This challenge is going to be around PWA. 

At the end of the Challenge, your application needs to pass the PWA section in Lighthouse dev tool.

1. You should be able to identify all the static content that we use and cache it on our service worker. 
2. You should be able to add your website to the homepage of your device as a web app ( manifist.json )


##### Resoruces for this challenge

- [Service Worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers)
- [Storage for the Web](https://web.dev/storage-for-the-web/) 
- [Add a web app manifest](https://web.dev/add-manifest/)


#### Challenge 3 - Micro-Interactions

It's time for the Micro-interactions

On the design you will find a menu button on the menu, when you click that button it should open a side menu, the transition between openinig and closing the menu should be animated, please go creative and use whatever you think will work.


#### Challenge 4 - Performance

The performance score in the Lighthouse dev tool should be as close to 100 as possible.


### Delivery of the project

After you finish your project upload it to https://www.netlify.com/ or similar platforms, please share the URL and the github repository of the project with moath.alobaidat@maf.ae, mohammad.ihmaid@maf.ae


Thank you!
Good Luck.
